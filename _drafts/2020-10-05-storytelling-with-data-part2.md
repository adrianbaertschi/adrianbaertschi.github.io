# Declutter
Goal: Minimize perceived cognitive load
Cognitive load: "How hard do I have to think to understand it"
Perceived: "What do I think how hard I have to think"

Examples of clutter:
Long text without focus
Center aligned text
Diagonal lines
Diagonal text in graphs
No overall order (Z-shape) from top left of the slide

Example of two slides, content is identical

# Focus the Attention
After decluttering the visuals, bring the focus on where you want it and frame the discussion.
Exaples:
- Color
- Bold
- Contrast

other possible additions:
- Title with call to action
- Clarifying text to avoid misinterpretation

# Storytelling
Conventional rhetoric
- Arguments in bullet points
- Tell the facts
- Audience is arguing with me in their heads

What is a story?
- How and why life changes
- Balance  -> event –> conflict –> resultion
- Character we care about

### Classic 3 act story

**Act 1**
- Build context and common ground
- Introduce characters and desires
- Protagonist: your audience
- What is in for me?

**Act 2**
- Give examples
- Quote external content or people
- Present data
- Tell what happens if we do nothing
- Provide options
- Illustrate the benefits

**Act 3**
- Reveal what they can do to save the world, tell what you did
- What you want your adience to do
- Tie back to the beginning

### Other tools
Repetition
Horizontal logic: Read just the titles, does it make sense
Vertical logic: Is each slide consistent on its own
