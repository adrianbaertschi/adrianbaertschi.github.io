# Chapter 1: The imortance of context

- Exploratory: What you do to undertand the data
- Explanatory: Selected knowledge with purpose
- Use explanatory for presenting

- Who: Your Adience
  - Define specific
  - Your relationship with the audience
  - Expectations
- What: Action
  - Propose, ask for action
  - Choose right medium (presentation, email)
  - Avoid mix and compromise (slideument)
  - Choose the right tone
- How
  - What data is there that is useful
  - Ignore nonsupporting data

- Reduce to the max
  - 3 Minute story
  - Elevator pitch

Avoid PowerPoint early, use analog tool like storyboarding (PostIt notes)

# Chaper 2: Choosing an effective visual
### Simple text / Big number
One number that stays with the audience

### Tables
- Audience reads values from left to right
- Design should fade in the background, avoid fancy Excel formattings

![Table formatting](/assets/storytelling_with_data/tables.png)

### Heatmap
- Helps the reader to see the different values
- Make sure to add a legend to clarify the colors

![Heatmaps](/assets/storytelling_with_data/heatmaps.png)

## Graphs
- Interact with visual system => processed faster

### Scatterplot
- Shows Datapoints on two axes
- Shows relationships of two things
- Discover trends and similarities
- Take time to explain to audience

### Line Graph
- Continuous data, often timeseries
- Label series directly

![Line graph](/assets/storytelling_with_data/linegraph.png)

### Slopegraph
- Two series of data
- Want to show the differences
- Example: Survey before/after on several topics
- Works best if lines do not overlap

### Bar chart
- Very flexible usage (vertical, horizontal, stacked, etc.)
- Easy to understand
- Good comparison between values

![Bar charts](/assets/storytelling_with_data/bar_charts.png)

### Area Graph
- Show relationship
- Use Rectangular shapes instead of round

# Declutter
Goal: Minimize perceived cognitive load
Cognitive load: "How hard do I have to think to understand it"
Perceived: "What do I think how hard I have to think"

Examples of clutter:
Long text without focus
Center aligned text
Diagonal lines
Diagonal text in graphs
No overall order (Z-shape) from top left of the slide

Example of two slides, content is identical

# Focus the Attention
After decluttering the visuals, bring the focus on where you want it and frame the discussion.
Exaples:
- Color
- Bold
- Contrast

other possible additions:
- Title with call to action
- Clarifying text to avoid misinterpretation
 
# Storytelling
Conventional rhetoric
- Arguments in bullet points
- Tell the facts
- Audience is arguing with me in their heads

What is a story?
- How and why life changes
- Balance  -> event –> conflict –> resultion
- Character we care about

### Classic 3 act story

**Act 1**
- Build context and common ground
- Introduce characters and desires
- Protagonist: your audience
- What is in for me?

**Act 2**
- Give examples
- Quote external content or people
- Present data
- Tell what happens if we do nothing
- Provide options
- Illustrate the benefits

**Act 3**
- Reveal what they can do to save the world, tell what you did
- What you want your adience to do
- Tie back to the beginning

### Other tools
Repetition
Horizontal logic: Read just the titles, does it make sense
Vertical logic: Is each slide consistent on its own
