# Chapter 1: The importance of context

- Exploratory: What you do to undertand the data
- Explanatory: Selected knowledge with purpose
- Use explanatory for presenting

- Who: Your audience
  - Define specific
  - Your relationship with the audience
  - Expectations
- What: Action
  - Propose, ask for action
  - Choose right medium (presentation, email)
  - Avoid mix and compromise (slideument)
  - Choose the right tone
- How
  - What data is there that is useful
  - Ignore nonsupporting data

- Reduce to the max
  - 3 Minute story
  - Elevator pitch

Avoid PowerPoint early, use analog tool like storyboarding (PostIt notes)

# Chapter 2: Choosing an effective visual
### Simple text / Big number
One number that stays with the audience

### Tables
- Audience reads values from left to right
- Design should fade in the background, avoid fancy Excel formattings

### Heatmap
- Helps the reader to see the different values
- Make sure to add a legend to clarify the colors

## Graphs
- Interact with visual system => processed faster

### Scatterplot
- Shows Datapoints on two axes
- Shows relationships of two things
- Discover trends and similarities
- Take time to explain to audience

### Line Graph
- Continuous data, often timeseries
- Label series directly

### Slopegraph
- Two series of data
- Want to show the differences
- Example: Survey before/after on several topics
- Works best if lines do not overlap

### Bar chart
- Very flexible usage (vertical, horizontal, stacked, etc.)
- Easy to understand
- Good comparison between values
