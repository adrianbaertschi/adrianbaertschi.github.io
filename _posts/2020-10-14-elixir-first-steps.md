title: First steps with elixir
---

After I went throught the [elixir getting-started guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)
I finally managed to finish the official [Introduction to Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
tutorial from the elixir website.

- Tools used
  - IntelliJ IDEA with plugin
  - Support for umbrella projects?
- experience
  - Syntax is hard
  - lot of framework (Genserver, Tasks, Supervisor, etc, etc.)
  - all-inclusive (build-tool, lang+framework)
  - Autocomplete missing
  - Parameter info would be helpful
  - Good testing support
