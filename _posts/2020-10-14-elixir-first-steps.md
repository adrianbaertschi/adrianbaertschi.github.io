title: First steps with Elixir
---

After I went through the [Getting-started guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)
I finally managed to finish the
official [Introduction to Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
tutorial from the Elixir website. The guide covers building a distributed key-value store from scratch. Split in small
steps the tutorial introduces the core concepts of the language and ecosystem.

- The good stuff
    - Iterative style of the tutorial
    - Elixir as an all-inclusive ecosystem (build-tool, lang+framework)
    - Excellent testing support

- Challenges
    - Syntax was hard and felt very unfamiliar to me
    - Lot of framework, concepts (Genserver, Tasks, Supervisor, etc.)
    - IDE support is ok but some features are missing (better autocomplete, parameter info). I used IntelliJ with elixir
      plugin.
